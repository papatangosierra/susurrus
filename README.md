# Susurrus

Susurrus is a multiplayer countdown timer. It's designed to be a simple, low-friction tool that embodies some aspects of the [body doubling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_doubling) approach to doing work.

When you visit the base Susurrus site, it immediately creates a new webpage for your timer and redirects you to the address for that page. The page is ephemeral and exists for only as long as you are using it.

The page’s URL functions as the invitation to join the timer. To invite someone to join, just send them the URL of your timer’s page.

You can also create a timer with a custom URL by entering your own text after `/timers/` in the browser's address bar. For example, `https://susurrus.com/timers/my-cool-timer` will create a timer with the name "my-cool-timer".

Susurrus requires no signup or login information. Upon connecting, each user gets a randomly generated name that lasts only as long as they are viewing the timer.

Only a timer's owner can start, reset, and edit the timer. A timer's owner is initially the user who created the timer. If the owner leaves the timer while other users are still present, owner status will be given to one of the remaining users.

If you can see the start/reset button on the timer, you are its owner.

The timer's duration can be adjusted using either the arrows above and below the digits, or by dragging and rotating the dial.

If the owner changes the timer's duration, those changes are visible to other users of the timer. When the owner starts the timer, it will start counting down for all users.

When a timer completes, a short melody plays.

The **Ping** button plays an audible ping sound for all users of the timer. Each user's ping has a different pitch, and when a ping is received, the pinging user's name briefly flashes to indicate its source.

A ping is meant to send a signal of continuing presence—an "I'm still doing this" message. Depending on the specific context in which the timer is being used, a ping could signal the completion of a unit of work—a sentence or paragraph of writing drafted, a surface dusted, a piece of mail sorted, whatever—or just a simple "hey!"

Owing to the nature of web browser audio, you will not be able to hear any pings until you send a ping yourself. 

As a reward for reading to the end of this file, here's an easter egg: If you're on a computer with a physical keyboard, try holding down the `j` or `k` keys for several seconds.

Give feedback to Paul. If you're using Susurrus right now, you either know how to contact him or you know someone who does. Alternatively, you can submit feedback [here](https://airtable.com/app3oY6TYzHGhFoBj/shrtV749UvfGqgdim).
