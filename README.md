## A timer for the group chat

[Susurrus](https://susurrus.app/) is a multiplayer countdown timer. It's designed to be a simple, low-friction tool that embodies some aspects of the [body doubling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_doubling) approach to doing work.

When you visit the base Susurrus site, it immediately creates a page for a new timer and redirects you to it. The page is ephemeral, and exists for only as long as someone is using it.

The page’s URL functions as the invitation to join the timer. To invite someone to join, just send them the URL of your timer’s page.

You can also create a timer with a custom URL by entering your own text after `/timers/` in the browser's address bar. For example, `https://susurrus.app/timers/my-cool-timer` will create a timer at that URL that other users can join.

Susurrus requires no signup or login information. Upon connecting to a timer, each user gets a randomly generated name that lasts only as long as they are viewing the timer.

The timer's duration can be adjusted using either the arrows above and below the digits, or by dragging and rotating the dial.

If one of the users in a timer changes the timer's duration, those changes are visible to other users of the timer. When a user starts the timer, it will start counting down for all users.

When a timer completes, a short melody plays.

The **Ping** button plays an audible ping sound for all users of the timer. Each user's ping has a different pitch, and when a ping is received, the pinging user's name briefly flashes to indicate its source.

A ping is meant to send a signal of continuing presence—an "I'm still doing this" message. Depending on the specific context in which the timer is being used, a ping could signal the completion of a unit of work—a sentence or paragraph of writing drafted, a surface dusted, a piece of mail sorted, whatever—or just a simple "hey!"

Owing to the nature of web browser audio, you will not be able to hear any pings until you send a ping yourself. 

As a reward for reading to the end of this file, here's an easter egg: If you're on a computer with a physical keyboard, try holding down the `j` or `k` keys for several seconds.
